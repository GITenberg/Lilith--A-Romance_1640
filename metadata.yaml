description: "Lilith is a fantasy novel written by Scottish writer George MacDonald\
  \ and first published in 1895. Its importance was recognized in its later revival\
  \ in paperback by Ballantine Books as the fifth volume of the celebrated Ballantine\
  \ Adult Fantasy series in September 1969.\nLilith is considered among the darkest\
  \ of MacDonald's works, and among the most profound. It is a story concerning the\
  \ nature of life, death, and salvation. In the story, MacDonald mentions a cosmic\
  \ sleep that heals tortured souls, preceding the salvation of all. MacDonald was\
  \ a Christian universalist, believing that all will eventually be saved. However,\
  \ in this story, divine punishment is not taken lightly, and salvation is hard-won.\n\
